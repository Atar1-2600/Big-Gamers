 2. **Brute Force:**
 
       Doing trial and error style of way to decipher a phrase
       
 3. **Frequency Analysis:**
    
      Noticing patterns in an encryption and using that to determine what the phrase is. 
      
 4. **Cribs:**
 
      The term cribbing in cryptography refers to the process of inferring key and plaintext from ciphertext based on partial knowledge of the plaintext.
      
 5. **One-Time Pad Encryption:**
